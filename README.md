# Austin AirBnB EDA

Project 1: Using AirBnB data to understand the homeowners' market in Austin
1. Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
IPython (display module)
collections
itertools (chain module)
time

2. Project Motivation
This project is part of Term 2's first module (Introduction to Data Science) requirement, which is to use the CRISP-DM process to produce a data project. I utilised AirBnB data on Austin homes to produce my project, which used the perspective of a Seattle home-owner. The objective is to offer a great experience for my guests while maximizing revenues. Thus, I explored ways to achieve this objective by using data to answer the following three questions:

a. How are prices are changed seasonally in Austin?
b. What are the most common amenities that local hosts offer?
c. What types of property more likely yield profit to the rental investors?

3. File Descriptions
This repo contains:
- Three original datasets: listing, calendar, reviews from AirBnB
- EDA notebook to explore Austin rental data

4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
All Austin AirBnB data was obtained from public Airbnb database.
